          Deepsel was founded in 2019 by Tim Tran - a software engineer in Hanoi, whose mission was to tap and grow
          the next generation of software
          developers and deliver excellence in software products. Initially building custom software for ecommerce
          businesses in Vietnam, Deepsel discovered the growing need, as well as the shortage and high costs, of
          software engineering in developed
          countries. Tim sought to connect these needs with the growing pool of highly
          skilled technical talents in Vietnam.

          When billing for a fixed priced project, billing will be divided into milestones based on project
          completion. Some projects may require a deposit.

          If billing by the hour, we invoice weekly. Payment is due within 3 business days.

          We can not sign an NDA before we have an initial description of your project and a budget figure to work
          with.
          We need to know if the requirements and client's expectations are a good fit to work with Deepsel, and an
          NDA
          can only
          be signed if it's a mutual agreement.

          Yes we can. We'll need a live demo of the software and access to audit your code. Once that's done, we'll

          This can only be answered after the requirements collection process. After learning about the problem you're
          trying to solve, your budget, users, market, ...etc.
          we can then propose a solution that solves the problem while staying in your budget. This is
          the software consulting part of the project, and we give 4 free consulting hours per project. The result
          will be
          a proposal with a cost estimation.
